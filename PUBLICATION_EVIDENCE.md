## Still Not Publication Approval

The following gates are intentionally not resolved by this generated evidence:

- production-readiness approval beyond this public beta release;
- owner approval of current `NOTICE` and `TRADEMARKS.md` wording;
- human/project approval of third-party notices and public bootstrap strategy;
- owner approval of the browser/runtime proof target and final local proof chain;
- semantic public docs/screenshot wording review beyond the deterministic media audit;
- fresh Computer Use release-readiness pass after material blockers are remediated;
- final manual GitHub repository creation and remote push.
